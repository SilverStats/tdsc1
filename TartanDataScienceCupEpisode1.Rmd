Authors: Devin Cortese, Max Horowitz, Steven Silverman

# Introduction 

With funding allocated to open two new Citi Bike Stands in New York City, our group was tasked with finding optimal locations for the stands to increase ridership, specifically for female ridersfor.

We merged the census data with the given dataset to improve the accuracy and rigor of our methods resulting in our final suggestions.

Starting with intitial Exploratory Data Analysis, our group examained distribution of checks 


We omitted tract data corresponding to Staten Island and The Bronx due to their relative geographic remotness. Using the census data
